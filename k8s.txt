Day 16
=======================
KUBERNETES
=======================

Menions: This is an individual node used in kubernetes
Combination of these minions is called as Kubernetes cluster

Master is the main machine which triggers the container orchestraion
It distributes the work load to the Slaves

Slaves are the nodes that accept the work load from the master
and handle activites load balancing,autoscalling,high availability etc



Kubernetes uses various of types of Object

1 Pod: This is a layer of abstraction on top of a container.This is the samallest
  object that kubernetes can work on.In the Pod we have a container.
  The advantage of using a Pod is that kubectl commands will work on the Pod and the 
  Pod communicates these instructions to the container.In this way we can use the
  same  kubectl irresepective of which technology containers are in the Pod.



2 Service: This is used for port mapping and network load balancing

3 NameSpace: This is used for creating partitions in the cluster.Pods running
 in a namespace cannot communicate with other pods running in other namespace

4 Secrets: This is used for passing encrypted data to the Pods

5 ReplicationController: This is used for managing multiple replicas of PODs
and also perfroming saclling 

6 ReplicaSet: This is similar to replicationcontroller but it is more advanced
where features like selector can be implemented

7 Deployment: This used for perfroming all activites that a Replicaset can do
  it can also handle rolling update

8 PersistantVolume: Used to specify the section of storage that should be used for volumes

9 PersistantVolumeClaims: Used to reserver a certain amout of storage for a pod from the
  persistant volume.

10 Statefulsets: These are used to handle stateful application like data bases
  where consistency in read write operations has to be maintained.

11 HorrizontalPodAutScaller: Used for auto scalling of pods depending on the load


Kubernetes Architecture
=============================
Master Componentes
=======================
Container runtime: This can be docker or anyother container technology

apiServer: Users interact with the apiServer using some clinet like ui,command line tool like kubelet.It is the apiServer which is the gateway to the cluster
It works as a gatekeeper  for authentication and it validates if a specific
user is having permissions to execute a specific command.Example if we want to
deploy a pod or a deployment first apiServers validates if the user is authorised to perform that action and if so it passes to the next process
ie the "Scheduler"

Scheduler: This process accepts the instructions from apiServer after validation
and starts an application on a sepcific node or set of nodes.It estimates
how much amount of h/w is required for an application and then checks which
slave have the necessary h/w resources and instructs the kubelet to deploy
the application

kubelet: This is the actual process that takes the orders from scheduler and
deploy an application on a slave.This kubelet is present on both master and slave

controller manager: This check if the desired state of the cluster is always
maintained.If a pod dies it recreates that pod to maintain the desired state

etcd: Here the cluster state is maintained in key value pairs.
It maintains info about the slaves and the h/w resources available on
the slaves and also the pods running on the slaves
The scheduler and the control manager read the info from this etcd
and schedule the pods and maintain the desired state

===========================================================================
Worker components
=======================
containerrun time: Docker or some other container technology

kubelet: This process interacts with container run time and the node 
and it start a pod with a container in it

kubeproxy: This will take the request from services to pod
It has the intellegence to forward a request to
a near by pod.Eg If an application pod wants to communicate with a db pod
then kubeproxy will take that request to the nearby pod 

========================================================================
Day 17
========================================================================
Kubernetes on AWS using Kops
1. Launch Linux EC2 instance in AWS (Kubernetes Client)
2. Create and attach IAM role to EC2 Instance.
Kops need permissions to access
	S3
	EC2
	VPC
	Route53
	Autoscaling
	etc..
3. Install Kops on EC2
curl -LO https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/releases/download/$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kops/releases/latest | grep tag_name | cut -d '"' -f 4)/kops-linux-amd64
chmod +x kops-linux-amd64
sudo mv kops-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/kops

4. Install kubectl
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
chmod +x ./kubectl
sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
5. Create S3 bucket in AWS
S3 bucket is used by kubernetes to persist cluster state, lets create s3 bucket using aws cli Note: Make sure you choose bucket name that is uniqe accross all aws accounts

aws s3 mb s3://sai.in.k8s --region ap-south-1
6. Create private hosted zone in AWS Route53
Head over to aws Route53 and create hostedzone
Choose name for example (sai.in)
Choose type as privated hosted zone for VPC
Select default vpc in the region you are setting up your cluster
Hit create
7 Configure environment variables.
Open .bashrc file

	vi ~/.bashrc
Add following content into .bashrc, you can choose any arbitary name for cluster and make sure buck name matches the one you created in previous step.

export KOPS_CLUSTER_NAME=newsai.in
export KOPS_STATE_STORE=s3://newsai.in.k8s
Then running command to reflect variables added to .bashrc

	source ~/.bashrc
8. Create ssh key pair
This keypair is used for ssh into kubernetes cluster

ssh-keygen
9. Create a Kubernetes cluster definition.
kops create cluster \
--state=${KOPS_STATE_STORE} \
--node-count=2 \
--master-size=t3.medium \
--node-size=t3.medium \
--zones=us-west-2a \
--name=${KOPS_CLUSTER_NAME} \
--dns private \
--master-count 1
10. Create kubernetes cluster
kops update cluster --yes --admin
Above command may take some time to create the required infrastructure resources on AWS. Execute the validate command to check its status and wait until the cluster becomes ready

kops validate cluster
For the above above command, you might see validation failed error initially when you create cluster and it is expected behaviour, you have to wait for some more time and check again.

11. To connect to the master
ssh admin@api.javahome.in
Destroy the kubernetes cluster
kops delete cluster  --yes
Update Nodes and Master in the cluster
We can change numner of nodes and number of masters using following commands

   kops edit ig nodes change minSize and maxSize to 0
   kops get ig- to get master node name
   kops edit ig - change min and max size to 0
   kops update cluster --yes


The offical documentation of KOPS can be viewed at

Kubernetes Definition file
=================================
Kubernetes performs container orchestration uisng certain definition
file.These files are created using yml and they have 4 top level
fields

apiVersion:
kind:
metadata:
spec:

apiVersion: Every kubernetes object uses a specific Kubernetes code
library that is called apiVersion.Only once this code library is imported
we can start working on specific objects

kind: This represents the type of Kubernetes object that we want to us
      eg: Pod,Replicaset,Service etc

metadata: Here we give a name to the Kubernetes object and also some
          labels.These labels can be used later for performing group
          activites

spec: This is where we store info about the exact docker image,container name
      environment varibales,port mapping etc


Kind              apiVersion
=================================
Pod               v1
Service           v1
NameSpace         v1
Secrets           v1
ReplicationController v1
PersistantVolume   v1
PersistantVolumeClaim  v1
ReplicaSet        apps/v1
Deployment        apps/v1
StatefulSet       apps/v1
DaemonSet         apps/v1




==============================================================================




UseCase-1

 name: nginx-pod
 labels:
  author: intellqit
  type: reverse-proxy
spec:
 containers:
  - name: appserver
    image: nginx
...

To create a pod from the above file
kubectl create -f pod-defintion1.yml

kubectl get pods

To see the pods along with the ipaddress and name of the slave where it is running
kubectl get pods -o wide

To delete the pods created from the above file
kubectl delete -f pod-definition1.yml


=========================================================================
Create a pod defintion file to start a postgres container
Name of the container should be mydb,pass the necssary environment
variables,this container should run in a pod called postgres-pod
and give the labels as author=intelliqit and type=database


vim pod-definition2.yml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: postgres-pod
 labels:
  author: intelliqit
  type: database
spec:
 containers:
  - name: mydb
    image: postgres

kubectl create -f pod-defintion2.yml

To delete the pods
kubectl delete -f pod-definition2.yml



========================================================================
UseCase 3
Create a pod defintion file to start a jenkins container in a pod
called jenkins-pod,also perform port mapping to access the jenkins
from a browser

vim pod-definition3.yml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: jenkins-pod
 labels:
  author: intelliqit
  type: ci-cd
spec:
 containers:
  - name: myjenkins
    image: jenkins
    ports:
     - containerPort: 8080
       hostPort: 8080
...

To create pods from the above file
kubectl create -f pod-defintion3.yml

To see the list of pods along with nodes where they are running
kubectl get nodes -o wide

To get the external ip of the node
kubectl get node -o wide

To access then jenkins from browser
external_ip_of_slavenode:8080

=======================================================================
Day 21
======================================================================
ReplicationController
=======================
This is a high level Kubernets object that can be used for handling 
multiple replicas of a Pod.Here we can perfrom Load Balancing
and Scalling

ReplicationController uses keys like "replicas,template" etc in the "spec" section
In the template section we can give metadata related to the pod and also use
another spec section where we can give containers information

Create a replication controller for creating 3 replicas of httpd
vim repilication-controller.yml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
 name: httpd-rc
 labels:
  author: intelliqit
spec:
 replicas: 3
 template:
  metadata:
   name: httpd-pod
   labels:
    author: intelliqit
  spec:
   containers:
    - name: myhttpd
      image: httpd
      ports:
       - containerPort: 80
         hostPort: 8080
...

To create the httpd replicas from the above file
kubectl create -f replication-controller.yml

To check if 3 pods are running an on whcih slaves they are running
kubectl get pods -o wide

To delete the replicas
kubectl delete -f replication-controller.yml
=========================================================================


ReplicaSet
===================
This is also similar to ReplicationController but it is more
advanced and it can also handle load balancing and scalling
It has an additional field in spec section called as "selector"
This selector uses a child element "matchLabels" where the
it will search for Pod based on a specific label name and try to add
them to the cluster

Create a replicaset file to start 4 tomcat replicas  and then perform scalling
vim replica-set.yml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
 name: tomcat-rs
 labels:
  type: webserver
  author: intelliqit
spec:
 replicas: 4
 selector:
  matchLabels:
   type: webserver
   
 template:
  metadata:
   name: tomcat-pod
   labels:
    type: webserver
  spec:
   containers:
    - name: mywebserver
      image: tomee
      ports:
       - containerPort: 8080
         hostPort: 9090

To create the pods from the above file
kubectl create -f replica-set.yml

Scalling can be done in 2 ways
a) Update the file and later scale it

b) Scale from the coomand prompt withbout updating the defintion file

a) Update the file and later scale it
  Open the replicas-set.yml file and increase the replicas count from 4 to 6
  kubectl replace -f replicas-set.yml
  Check if 6 pods of tomcat are running
  kubectl get pods

b) Scale from the coomand prompt withbout updating the defintion file
   kubectl scale --replicas=2 -f replica-set.yml


================================================================
Deployment
================

This is also a high level Kubernetes object which can be used for
scalling and load balancing and it can also perfrom rolling update

Create a deployment file to run nginx with 3 replicas


vim deployment1.yml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
 name: nginx-deployment
 labels:
  author: intelliqit
  type: proxyserver
spec:
 replicas: 3
 selector:
  matchLabels:
   type: proxyserver
 template:
  metadata:
   name: nginx-pod
   labels:
    type: proxyserver
  spec:
   containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx
      ports:
       - containerPort: 80
         hostPort: 8888
 
To create the deployment from the above file
kubectl create -f deployment.yml

To check if the deployment is running
kubectl get deployment

To see if all 3 pod of nginx are running
kubectl get pod

Check the version of nginx
kubectl describe pods nginx-deployment | less



==================================================================================
Create a mysql deployment
vim deployment2.yml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql-deployment
  labels:
    type: db
    author: intelliqit
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      type: db
  template:
    metadata:
      name: mysql-pod
      labels:
        type: db
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: mydb
          image: mysql
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3306
              hostPort: 8080
          env:
            - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
              value: intelliqit


=============================================================================
Service Object
=====================

This is used for network load balancing and port mapping
It uses 3 ports
1 target port:  Pod or container port
2 port:   Service port
3 hostPort:  Host machines port to make it accessable from external network

Service objects are classified into 3 types
1 clusterIP: This is the default type of service object used in
  Kubernetes and it is used when we want the Pods in the cluster to
  communicate with each other and not with extrnal networks

2 nodePort: This is used if we want to access the pods from an extrnal
  network and it also performs network load balancing ie even if a pod
  is running on a specific salve we can access it from other slave in
  the cluster

3 LoadBalancer: This is similar to Nodeport and it is used for external 
  connectivity of a Pod and also network load balancing and it also assigns
  a public ip for all the slave combined together


Use Case
=================
Create a service defintion file for port mapping an nginx pod

vim pod-defintion1.yml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: nginx-pod
 labels:
  author: intellqit

spec:
 type: NodePort
 ports:
  - targetPort: 80
    port: 80
    nodePort: 30008
 selector:
  author: intellqit
  type: reverse-proxy

Create pods from the above pod definition file
kubectl create -f pod-definition1.yml
Create the service from the above service definition file
kubectl create -f service.yml
Now nginx can be accesed from any of the slave
kubectl get nodes -o wide
Take the external ip of any of the nodes:30008

================================================================
Taints and toleration
========================
Taints and Tolerations
Node affinity, is a property of Pods that attracts them to a set of nodes (either as a preference or a hard requirement). Taints are the opposite -- they allow a node to repel a set of pods.

Tolerations are applied to pods, and allow (but do not require) the pods to schedule onto nodes with matching taints.

Taints and tolerations work together to ensure that pods are not scheduled onto inappropriate nodes. One or more taints are applied to a node; this marks that the node should not accept any pods that do not tolerate the taints.

To create a taint for a node
kubectl taint nodes node1 node=intelliqit:NoSchedule

To delete the tain
kubectl taint nodes node1 node=intelliqit:NoSchedule-
